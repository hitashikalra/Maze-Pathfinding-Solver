# Maze Pathfinding Solver

## Overview
A C++ application that visualizes A* and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithms to solve mazes efficiently, with real-time exploration and shortest-path highlights.

## Features
- **A* Algorithm**: Finds the optimal path using a heuristic-based search.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Determines the shortest path based on uniform cost.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Displays explored paths and highlights the final shortest path.

## Requirements
Install the required dependencies for building and running the project:

- **C++11 or higher**
- **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics.

### Install SFML:
- On macOS:
  ```bash
  brew install sfml

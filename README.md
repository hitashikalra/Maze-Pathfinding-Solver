# Maze Pathfinding Solver

## Overview
A Python application that visualizes A* and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithms to solve mazes efficiently, with real-time exploration and shortest-path highlights.

## Features
- **A* Algorithm** (Optimal path with heuristic-based search)
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (Shortest path based on uniform cost)
- Real-time visualization with explored paths and final shortest path.

## Requirements
Install the required dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
